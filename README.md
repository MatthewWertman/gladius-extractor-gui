# gladius-extractor-gui
A GUI creation for Jimb's Gladius data extractor tools to make it easier for anyone to mod this game


THIS IS A ROUGH FIRST RELEASE
How to make it work:
1. Download .jar file
2. Put it wherever you store your JimB python tools (it needs to be inside the tools folder)
3. Run the .jar
4. 
This now works with Windows!

MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO SPACES IN ANY OF YOUR FILE PATHS OR IT WILL NOT WORK (currently fixing this but it's slow going)
